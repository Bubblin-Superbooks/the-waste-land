<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Da</h4><pre class="  "><code>_Damyata:_ The boat responded
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded                       
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
To controlling hands

I sat upon the shore
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
_Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina
Quando fiam ceu chelidon_ — O swallow swallow
_Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie_
These fragments I have shored against my ruins</pre></div> </div>
