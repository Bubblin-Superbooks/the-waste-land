HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.                    
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
