Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,                             
The pleasant whining of a mandoline
And a clatter and a chatter from within
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
Of Magnus Martyr hold
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.

     The river sweats
     Oil and tar
     The barges drift
     With the turning tide
     Red sails                                                          
     Wide
     To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
     The barges wash
     Drifting logs
